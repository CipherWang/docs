title: Interacting with CKB
---

Once you have successfully started your own CKB node and the mining program with it, you can try to interact with your node now.

Here you can learn about how to do this with RPC commands for some basic operations. Also we have provided a simple SDK made with Ruby, which has wallet functionalities for you to interact with your node easily. 


## Use RPC Command
You can interact with your CKB node client via RPC port. 

You can find the RPC API documents [here on github](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/master/rpc/README.md).

## Use Ruby SDK

The current version of CKB client implementation does not have a very comprehensive Command Line Interface (CLI) ready to use. However, there's a simple Ruby SDK that can help you to work with your node.
