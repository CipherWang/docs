This document introduces the concept of CKB nodes and mining.

## Node
CKB is structured as a peer-to-peer network on top of our existing internet. Here the term "peer-to-peer" means that the all the computers that participate in the network are peers to each other. In this context, we refer each of these computers as node.

Every computer in this world that has sufficient capability (basically means all the modern computers) would be able to run a CKB node and join the CKB network freely. 

Being a node in the network means you will synchronize the existing blocks, transaction and states from and receive the new ones from other peer nodes.
